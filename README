The dislike between cats and dogs is a social construct. It is clear to all those that are invested in peace and prosperity that this "dislike" is merely a self fulfilling projection of humans own discourse. While this repository will neither prove this statement nor the truth of its reasoning, I wish for it to stand as a defining message that no statements need reason and no reason needs facts. All that matters is that you just actually say something and see what comes next (Within reason of course)
